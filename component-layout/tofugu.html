        <p>
          Because of the reviews and sales of the movie, I was really curious.
          Among the ton of anime out there, Shinkai Makoto’s work has its own
          style and originality. Personally, the detailed backgrounds based on
          real locations in Tokyo moved me, and
          <a href="#">it made me want to go on a pilgrimage to the locations</a
          >. Also the music by Rad Wimps (who I spend my high school years
          listening to) matched the story and emotion well. The story wasn’t
          predictable, so I think it was one of the reasons behind the movie’s
          huge success.
